Paint Clone in C++
==================

Introduction
------------

A C++ application which achieves basic paint functionality. It uses the Qt application framework. 

Features
--------

It is currently very low-featured (you can draw, and resize, but that's about it). Eventually I hope to have loading/saving of files, and various other things working.
